All pictures at directory

For creating project i used WebStorm, CSS, HTML and grid

First, I created a site grid with Grid,
Divide page to the main block: header, sidebar and content
Next divide all page to the div,
and then start to fill containers by content

I faced one problem that I could not solve. There is set onClick on div with sidebar and this is work
But when I press close button sidebar is closed and open at once.
I think this is becouse of open on click on div
